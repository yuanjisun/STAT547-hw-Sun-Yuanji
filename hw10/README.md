# README: Homework 10: Data from the Web

This is the folder for STAT 547M Homework 10. This homework is still based on my research in Oceanography, which are divided into 3 parts.

Part 1: Get weather information of major cities in China using API, and generate an interactive map. [Map is only supported in HTML version.]

Part 2: Get oceanographic data from a single WHOI website and generate plots.

Part 3: Get oceanographic data from a bunch of WHOI websites and generate plots. This work improves my speed of analyzing big data. It will be modified and create a package for my future research later.
