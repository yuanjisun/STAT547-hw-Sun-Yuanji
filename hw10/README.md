# README: Homework 10: Data from the Web

This is the folder for STAT 547M Homework 10. This homework is still based on my research in Oceanography, which are divided into 3 parts.

Part 1: Get weather information of major cities in China using API, and generate an interactive map. [Map is only supported in HTML version.]

Part 2: Get oceanographic data from a single WHOI website and generate plots.

Part 3: Get oceanographic data from a bunch of WHOI websites and generate plots. This work improves my speed of analyzing big data. It will be modified and create a package for my future research later. In Part 2, the data URL is the sublink of the URL used in Part 3. In the future, I only need to change the top-level URL and all sublinks will be generated, together with all figures. This is a part of automation.

__Note: Due to the security consideration, all API keys are replaced with `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`. Please get your own AKI key and replace `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` before running the code.__

__Since an interactive map is used in my homework, which is not supported by MD file, I knitted my homework into HTML.__
